Helpful Code Example:
An example of a Python function that uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

num = 5
print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
```
This example is particularly helpful in understanding how recursion works in Python.

Summary of an Informative Tutorial:
Tutorial: [Python's `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` Functions](https://realpython.com/python-map-filter-reduce/)
Summary:
This tutorial explains how the `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions work in Python. It provides practical examples of how these functions can be used to apply a function to every item in an iterable, filter items from an iterable, and reduce an iterable to a single value, respectively.

Key Insights:
- `map()` applies a given function to all items in an input list.
- `filter()` creates a list of elements for which a function returns true.
- `reduce()` applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list.

Example:
```python
from functools import reduce

# Using map() to square all numbers in a list
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
print(squared)

# Using filter() to filter out even numbers
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
print(evens)

# Using reduce() to sum all numbers in a list
total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print(total)
```
This tutorial is valuable for understanding functional programming in Python and how these higher-order functions can simplify code.

  def is_prime(num):
      if num > 1:
          for i in range(2, int(num/2)+1):
              if (num % i) == 0:
                  return False
          return True
      else:
          return False

  # Test the function
  print(is_prime(17))  # Output: True
  ```
  This exercise helps learners practice defining and using functions, as well as implementing logic for a common problem.
